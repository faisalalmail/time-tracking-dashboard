## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Challenges log for this challenge:
1. display the *report for* and *name* arranged in line with the dp.
2. 
**solution** sometimes things are complicated enough to make you think its not the easy fix you already know!

3. cropping the activity icon a little from the top and make it hide behind the next div instead of showing on top.
4. 
**solution** used negative margin on the image and applied `z-index` property to the divs. (turns out later in the project its better do put it as a background of the div instead of being an element)


*The matter of fact*, I dont think project was challenging, yes it was very new to me but I knew how to do it (in theory)**1.** I googled and read some text and learned how to process data from an array, **2.** I had the idea initially to create the cards as a loop for each item in the array instead of hard coding each card (how to do it is what I am proud to learn). **3** I call this the first project where a CSS grid is in action.

Overall, I would say I am very proud for completing this challenge for one reason *I am glad I spent this time focused on something that I loved doing*

### Continued development

Looking forward for the next challenge
